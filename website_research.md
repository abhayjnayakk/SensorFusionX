***

### **2. Biosignal Quality \& Artifact Challenges**

**The Signal Processing Problem:**

**Noise \& Artifacts in Biomedical Signals:**

- **ECG contamination**: EMG artifacts from muscle activity, motion artifacts from patient movement[^15][^16]
- **EEG signal quality**: Very low amplitude (~50-100 µV) easily corrupted by artifacts[^17][^18]
- **EOG artifacts**: 100-200 µV amplitude, **order of magnitude larger than EEG signals**[^18]
- **EMG contamination**: ECG artifacts when recording from muscles near the heart[^19][^20]

**Clinical Impact:**

- **Signal misinterpretation can lead to clinical misdiagnosis** (e.g., confusing artifacts with epileptiform activity)[^18]
- **Motion artifacts lead to misdiagnosis or repeated procedures** in wearable ECG monitoring[^16]
- **92% improvement in SNR required** for reliable artifact removal[^21]
- **Low SNR challenges**: Signals corrupted by motion, baseline drift, physiological variability[^22][^14]

**Current Limitations:**

- Traditional **single-sensor systems vulnerable to noise and environmental factors**[^22]

- **Missing modalities**: 40% of multimodal research cases face entire missing modality challenges[^25]
- **Low-level interaction loss**: Traditional late fusion ignores critical inter-modal dependencies[^26]

**Opportunity:**

- **Multimodal fusion outperforms unimodal approaches by 20-30%** in clinical studies[^24][^25]
